The problem statement of the mango trees is concerned with maximizing the minimum number of trees Rahul can obtain after his sister selects a number of larger fields.
Here's a breakdown of the problem:

Context: Rahul has the opportunity to decide where to make cuts in a field to divide it into smaller sections.
His sister will choose a certain number of larger fields.

Objective: The goal is for Rahul to maximize the number of trees he can get based on the cuts he makes.
Specifically, this means he wants to maximize the smallest number of trees in any section formed after making those cuts.

Example: If there are six trees in the initial arrangement, and by making specific cuts,
Rahul can create partitions with varying numbers of trees, he aims to create sections such that the minimum number of trees in any section is as large as possible.

In summary, the main task is to determine how to partition the fields such that Rahul's smallest section, in terms of the number of trees, is maximized.
